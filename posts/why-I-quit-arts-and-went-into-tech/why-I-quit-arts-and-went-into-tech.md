This is something I wanted to vent about for quite some time, one of the main reasons I stopped my pursuit of arts and switched into tech. I believe enough years have passed, that it won't affect 3rd parties in any meaningful fashion.

Best moment for me mention the blog's disclaimer from the about section again.

As opposed to my tech content, this one requires some exposition.
