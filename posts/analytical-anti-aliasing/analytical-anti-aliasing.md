> **Alden Kroll:** Two-dimensional HUD elements present a particular art problem, because they have to look good and sharp no matter what resolution the user is running their game at. Given today's availability of high resolution wide-screen displays, this can require a lot of texture memory and a lot of work anticipating different display resolutions. The problem for Team Fortress 2 was even more daunting because of our desire to include a lot of smooth curved elements in our HUD. We developed a new shader system for drawing 'line art' images. The system allows us to create images at a fixed resolution that produced smooth silhouettes even when scaled up to a very high resolution. This shader system also handles outlining and drop-shadows, and can be applied in the 3D space to world elements such as signs.

This technique is built with either the use of GLSL's [`fwidth()`](https://docs.gl/sl4/fwidth) or a combination of [`length()`](https://docs.gl/sl4/length) + [`dFdx()`](https://docs.gl/sl4/dFdx) + [`dFdy()`](https://docs.gl/sl4/dFdy).
This has been documented many times over, by many people in different forms. I use it so often, that I wanna write it down myself.

### Don't use [`smoothstep()`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep)
Its use is [often associated](http://www.numb3r23.net/2015/08/17/using-fwidth-for-distance-based-anti-aliasing/) with implementing anti-aliased in `GLSL`, but its use doesn't make sense. It performs a hermite interpolation, but the we are dealing with a function applied across 2 pixels or just inside 1. There is no curve to be witnessed here. Though the slight performance difference doesn't particularly matter on modern graphics cards so wasting cycles on performing the hermite interpolation doesn't make sense to me.



### We gotta talk 
See my Stackoverflow question '[How to ensure screen space derivatives are present on triangle edges?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73903568/how-to-ensure-screen-space-derivatives-are-present-on-triangle-edges)' for more details around the case of using this under 3D perspectives, not just 2D.
```glsl
	float dist = length(vtx_fs) - 0.9;
	float smoothedAlpha = dist / length(vec2(dFdx(dist), dFdy(dist)));
	/* float smoothedAlpha = dist / fwidth(dist); */
	gl_FragColor = vec4(color, alpha - smoothedAlpha);
```
```glsl
void main()
{
    float pixelsize = 0.5 * (fwidth(vtx_fs.x) + fwidth(vtx_fs.y));
    float dist = length(vtx_fs) - (1.0 - pixelsize);
    float smoothedAlpha = 1.5 * dist / fwidth(dist);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, alpha - smoothedAlpha);
}
```
```glsl
void main()
{
	float pixelsize = length(vec2(dFdx(vtx_fs.x), dFdy(vtx_fs.y)));
	float dist = length(vtx_fs) - (1.0 - pixelsize);
	float smoothedAlpha = dist / length(vec2(dFdx(dist), dFdy(dist)));
	gl_FragColor = vec4(color, alpha - smoothedAlpha);
}
```
### OpenGL and WebGL compatibility
This is compatible with all OpenGL and GLSL versions that use shaders. For OpenGL ***ES*** 2.0 and WebGL 1.0 you have to check for the existance of [OES_standard_derivatives](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/OES/OES_standard_derivatives.txt) and perform `#extension GL_OES_standard_derivatives : enable`, though I have never seen a device OpenGL ES 2.0 device, that did not support screen space derivatives.

Advanced font rendering uses `GL_EXT_blend_func_extended` sometimes to perform advanced blending, but that is not required for our Anti-Aliasing case.
