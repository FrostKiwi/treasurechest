Blur is essential - a fundamental tool, that a lot of graphics programming builds upon. [Depth of Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field), [Bloom](https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Phys.-Based-Bloom), [Frosted glass in UI elements](https://blog.frost.kiwi/GLSL-noise-and-radial-gradient/#kde-kwin-blur) all make use of it.


## Apple switches algorithms
Either reduced resolution, a switch to box blur with settings corresponding to the reduced resolution or guassian blur with a [small kernel but high sigma](https://usage.imagemagick.org/blur/#blur_args).
iPad 9th gen, iPadOS 18.4.1 10.2", 2160 x 1620 px --> 11x11 px
iPhone SE 34d gen, iOS 18.4.1, 1334 x 750 px --> 6x6 px

<blockquote class="reaction"><div class="reaction_text">Apple misconfigured the blur switch on iPadOS, for the top right settings pull down. The switch happens too soon, regressing blur strength and resulting in a pulse like artifact.</div><img class="kiwi" src="/assets/kiwis/detective.svg"></blockquote>


YouTube Channel [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile) did a lot on blurs and covered the mathematics behind them. I won't jump deep into the basic building blocks of kernels, convolutions and separability, as they have covered it already really well.

Playdead used it to get HDR Bloom

Check against Jimenez 14  5:45 onwards

This article kicked it off: [Link](https://www.rastergrid.com/blog/2010/09/efficient-gaussian-blur-with-linear-sampling/)

Marius Bjørge picked it up and [did a talk in 2015](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2776880.2787664) direct [video link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/suppl/10.1145/2776880.2787664/suppl_file/a184.mp4)

Masaki Kawase 川瀬正樹 history goes back some time, including modding and a personal page with [high and low graphics settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20040201224946/http://www.daionet.gr.jp/~masa/index.html)

To be able to innovate in blurs today you need to be very deep in mathematics and signal theory ***and*** computer graphics. Just looking at the level of genius needed to get fast bokeh blur is kinda insane. Functions cancelling each-other out, complex number theory
