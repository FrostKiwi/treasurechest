## Jōyō kanji Unicodes lists
These files allow you to select or subset just the  2136 [Jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) Unicode codepoints for Japanese. It's a good middle ground between having only Kana and including the all 21000 characters of the complete [CJK block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Unified_Ideographs_(Unicode_block)) for embedded use-cases. Note, that not all HEX codes are 4 digit, the last one 𠮟 is HEX 20B9F. Eyes open, in case your program you use these HEX values in is picky about formatting. It's a late edition to the Unicode standard [because resons](https://hydrocul.github.io/wiki/blog/2014/1201-shikaru.html) and is thus the only 5 digit HEX Jōyō kanji.
