## Jōyō kanji Unicodes lists
These files allow you to select or subset just the  2136 [Jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) Unicode codepoints for Japanese. It's a good middle ground between having only Kana and including the all 21000 characters of the complete [CJK block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Unified_Ideographs_(Unicode_block)) for embedded use-cases. Note, that not all HEX codes are 4 digit, the last one 𠮟 is HEX 20B9F. Eyes open, in case your program you use these HEX values in is picky about formatting. It's a late edition to the Unicode standard [because resons](https://hydrocul.github.io/wiki/blog/2014/1201-shikaru.html) and is thus the only 5 digit HEX Jōyō kanji.

### Regional variants
Finally, the usual applies if your are working with CJK fonts: Double, triple and quadruple check the font's intended region or in rare cases, how the font file organizes those regions internally. Eg. Google's Noto [offers their CJK fonts](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-cjk) in 'CJK SC (Simplified Chinese)', 'CJK TC (Traditional Chinese)', 'CJK JP (Japanese)', etc. Thanks to Unicode's aweful decision of [Han unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification), regional Sinograph variants are mapped to the same Unicode code point.

When my smartphone didn't have Japanese set as an optional language, the OS assumed the chinese variants by default and I was suddenly confused as to why I could not read some "Japanese" words in some apps. Such presumed defaults create issues in many [other](https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-anime-context-sentences/54003/83?u=frostkiwi) circumstances as well.
