This is a collection of useful things I want to share with the world.
## Jōyō kanji Unicodes lists
These files allow you to select or subset just the  2136 [Jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) Unicode codepoints for Japanese. It's a good middle ground between having only Kana and including the all 21000 characters of the complete [CJK block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Unified_Ideographs_(Unicode_block)) for embedded use-cases.
